There is a secret to knowing what you know and not knowing what you don't. Oh wait, that doesn't really make much sense, does it? It's just pseudo-philosophical bullshit. What would Eris think of that? But in the end, it doesn't even matter, does it? It's really difficult to write some text here that makes sense. Although, does it really have to? Probably not. It probably only has to be long enough for you to solve this challenge. I'm pretty sure you came up with a solution that wasn't the intended solution, because while testing, I noticed that the difference between picking the right values and the wrong values is pretty small. So I guess this could really be considered a guessing challenge, but if you guessed right, then you already noticed that sometimes the keystream becomes periodic. That's a funny property of chaotic functions. I was really hoping to find a better parameter range where there is zero probability to accidentally hit one of these stable orbits unless you provide the right number, but that turned out to be quite difficult. Maybe this PRNG is really not that good. I wonder why some people try to use it to encrypt real data with it then? If you want to learn more about it, then you should search for "Generalized Logistic Map". Although probably you don't really want to learn that much more about this stuff, you're really only here for the flag, right? Well, here you go: tstlss{0p3r4ti0n_M!nDfuCK_i5_a_fn0rD!} Makes me wonder if you earned it. Slippery when wet. Maintain 50mph. The Mgt.
